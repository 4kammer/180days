<p>Optimization tries many different solutions and scores the best one to use. One simple examples is using random guesses and scoring to determine which one is best. There are a number of issues that make this approach ineffective - one of which processing time. There are many problems where there just are too many options to consider.</p>

<a id="recommendation-engines" class="anchor" href="#recommendation-engines" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Recommendation Engines</h3>

<p>A recommendation engine is a great tool when searching for suggestions on a personal basis. In other words, the search results are tailored to the tastes of the user rather than some hard-coded attribute in the results (i.e. date created, keywords, synonyms, location).</p>

<p>One example of a recommendation is collaborative filtering. This method uses the historical preferences of a large group of other people to make a decision for you. One example is how Amazon displays similar books: people who liked book A and B also liked book C. Therefore, because you behaved similar to group X in that you liked book A and B, it is not a far leap to assume that you will also like book C.</p>
