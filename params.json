  "body": "### Welcome to 180 Days of Data.\r\nHere you will find 180 data products designed to give insight and add tangible value to the City of Los Angeles. \r\n\r\n### Predictive Analytics/AI\r\nSome of these products involve machine learning APIs that can easily turn data into a usable tool.\r\n\r\n### Optimization\r\nOptimization tries many different solutions and scores the best one to use. One simple examples is using random guesses and scoring to determine which one is best. There are a number of issues that make this approach ineffective - one of which processing time. There are many problems where there just are too many options to consider.\r\n\r\n### Recommendation Engines\r\nA recommendation engine is a great tool when searching for suggestions on a personal basis. In other words, the search results are tailored to the tastes of the user rather than some hard-coded attribute in the results (i.e. date created, keywords, synonyms, location).\r\n\r\nOne example of a recommendation is collaborative filtering. This method uses the historical preferences of a large group of other people to make a decision for you. One example is how Amazon displays similar books: people who liked book A and B also liked book C. Therefore, because you behaved similar to group X in that you liked book A and B, it is not a far leap to assume that you will also like book C.\r\n\r\n### Technologies/Languages:\r\nAzure Machine Learning API, D3.js, Django, Google Machine Learning API, iOS, Parse, Python, R, Ruby on Rails, Shiny, Swift\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nJeremy Molayem (@teamheisenberg)\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
